# Breast-Cancer-Git
My name is Kholoud Alwosaibai.
I'm interested in Breast Cancer Genetics. 
I would like to build a software that called"HotSpot"
I will try here to build codes that helps to classify the genetic variations that you will find from DNA genetic sequencing from breast cancer samples.
